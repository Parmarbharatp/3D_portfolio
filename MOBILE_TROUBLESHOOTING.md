3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Improved touch targets and animations
4. **Service Worker** - Enhanced caching for better offline experience
5. **Device Detection** - Smart optimization based on device capabilities

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements:
- Progressive image loading with fallbacks
- Mobile-specific 3D model optimizations
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Performance monitoring and device detection
- Enhanced caching strategy

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. 3D Model Not Loading on Mobile

**Symptoms:**
- 3D computer desk doesn't appear
- Loading spinner shows indefinitely
- White or broken image placeholders

**Solutions:**
- **Clear browser cache** - Mobile browsers cache large files aggressively
- **Check internet connection** - 3D models are large files (5MB+)
- **Try different browser** - Some mobile browsers handle WebGL better
- **Disable data saver** - Some mobile browsers block large downloads
- **Wait longer** - First load can take 30-60 seconds on slow connections
- **Refresh page** - New retry logic will attempt to reload automatically

### 2. Project Images Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Broken image icons in project cards
- Gray placeholder boxes
- "Image not available" messages

**Solutions:**
- **Automatic retry** - Images now retry loading automatically (up to 3 times)
- **Manual retry** - Click the "Retry" button on failed images
- **Refresh the page** - Images are cached and should load on retry
- **Check network connection** - Images are loaded from local assets
- **Clear browser cache** - Force reload of all assets

### 3. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow scrolling
- Laggy animations
- High battery usage

**Solutions:**
- **Close other apps** - Free up device memory
- **Use modern browser** - Chrome, Safari, Firefox latest versions
- **Disable battery saver** - Can limit performance
- **Check device storage** - Ensure sufficient free space
- **Wait for optimization** - Low-end devices show "Optimizing for your device" message

## Technical Optimizations Applied

### 1. Progressive Loading
- 3D model loads in background with retry logic
- Fallback UI shows while loading
- Smart device detection for optimal performance
- Progressive image loading with error handling

### 2. Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Reduced shadow quality on mobile (256 vs 1024)
- Disabled antialiasing on mobile for better performance
- Lower DPR (device pixel ratio) on mobile
- Conditional rendering of heavy components
- Touch-optimized interactions (44px minimum touch targets)

### 3. Enhanced Asset Caching
- Service worker caches 3D models and images
- Preloads critical assets
- Optimized build chunks
- Offline fallback for images

### 4. Smart Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for failed loads
- Loading states with progress indicators
- WebGL support detection
- Device capability assessment
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Device memory and CPU detection
- Network connection quality assessment
- Battery level monitoring
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome** (Android) - Full support with optimizations
- **Safari** (iOS) - Full support with optimizations
- **Firefox** (Android) - Full support with optimizations
- **Edge** (Android) - Full support with optimizations

### Minimum Requirements
- **WebGL support** - Required for 3D rendering (fallback provided)
- **ES6 support** - Required for React features
- **2GB RAM** - Recommended for smooth performance
- **Stable internet** - Required for initial load

## Performance Tips

1. **First Visit**: Allow 30-60 seconds for initial load
2. **Subsequent Visits**: Should load much faster due to enhanced caching
3. **Network**: Use WiFi for best experience
4. **Device**: Modern devices (2018+) work best
5. **Browser**: Keep browser updated for best performance

## New Features

### ðŸ”„ Automatic Retry System
- Images retry loading automatically up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload
- Visual feedback shows retry progress

### ðŸ“± Smart Device Detection
- Automatically detects mobile vs desktop
- Identifies low-end devices for optimization
- Adjusts performance settings accordingly

### ðŸŽ¯ Touch Optimization
- Larger touch targets (44px minimum)
- Reduced motion for accessibility
- Mobile-specific interaction patterns

### ðŸ’¾ Enhanced Caching
- Service worker for offline support
- Smart cache invalidation
- Progressive asset loading

## Debug Information

To check if WebGL is supported, open browser console and run:
```javascript
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl') || canvas.getContext('experimental-webgl');
console.log('WebGL supported:', !!gl);
```

To check device capabilities:
```javascript
console.log('Device Memory:', navigator.deviceMemory);
console.log('CPU Cores:', navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
console.log('Connection:', navigator.connection?.effectiveType);
```

## Contact

If issues persist, please provide:
- Device model and OS version
- Browser and version
- Network connection type
- Console error messages (if any)
